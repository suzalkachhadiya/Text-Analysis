Our Success Stories
Google LSA Ads (Google Local Service Ads) – ETL tools and Dashboards
Client Background
Client:
A leading marketing firm in the USA
Industry Type:
Marketing
Services:
Ads, Marketing, Campaign, Consulting
Organization Size:
200+
The Problem
The client has a Google LSA Ads Manager Account with about 100+ accounts and wishes to collect data available through the Google LSA API daily. The client wishes to set up a private Databases that is automatically created for newly added accounts and stores all of the collected data (Lead and Phone Call data). Finally, all collected data must be presented through the Google Looker Studio Dashboards, with the design layouts as suggested by the client.
Our Solution
The solution involves a number of Python-based ETL tools that are responsible for fetching the data from Google’s LSA API daily and updating the same in the Google BigQuery Databases.
Two different tools run are:
MCC Data Fetching tool.
Lead Record data fetching tool.
The fetched data is stored in BigQuery Databases on the client-provided (Google)manager account.
Carefully curated Google Looker Studio dashboards implemented with client-suggested theme layout which are updated upon client request, represent a number of KPIs and graphs indicating major data trends.
The designed dashboards have a number of data-controlling filters that filter the data account-wise and date-wise.

What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
Google LSA API is slow, high data fetching timelines.
BigQuery jobs fail, causing inconsistencies.

Regular weekly and monthly data refreshes update any inconsistent data.
