Our Solution
We have created a python web application with Django framework when user uploads the video the application run keras-ocr model on each frame of the video and keep the count of the wrong words at the end it provides the video with the bounding box around the words. For correct words it creates green bounding box and for wrong words it creates red bounding box and also it provides the summation of count of wrong words.
Project Deliverables
Deployed dockerized web application on google cloud which generate video with bounding box around texts
