Project Objective
For the current project, we hope to develop a real-time dashboard (* it updates every several minutes). Currently, we have multiple Ubuntu machines that are sending messages every minute to Apache Pulsar.
Project Description
Developing a realtime updating dashboard to display the metadata of various machines on a server from pandio queue.
The dahboard must display the count of “inactive” , “active” and “down” servers with a table displaying the details of all the machines in different color scheme for each type of server/machine.
Our Solution
We used Django framework to develop the dashboard as it didn’t require the ec2 instance to be active on machine which was the problem with using streamlit.
For communication between webpage and fetched data we used django channel .
We used django background task module to make the fetching run forever in background.
Project Deliverables
Real time updating Dashboard with separate color scheme for different types of machines.
Storing the historical data in sqlite3 db.
