Client Background
Client:
A Leading Logistics Firm Worldwide
Industry Type:
Logistics
Services:
Import, Export, Supply Chain, Logistics, Trades
Organization Size:
500+
Project Description
The main challenge faced by the team was the integration of the two systems themselves.
Since one-by-one entering of records into each module is a mundane task and a waste of valuable time we proposed the automation using APIs.
Our Solution
The challenge was divided into two milestones and sub-tasks for each.
1. First was the ingestion of existing data into the cloud-based CRM platform.
2. Second was the question of automating the process of adding newer records to the cloud platform.
Project Deliverables
The client has been provided with python scripting handling bulk data ingestion to CRM and also the script to handle daily synchronization of data.
Tools used
– Python
– MySQL Database
– Postman
– TeamViewer
Language/techniques used
– Automation
– 3
rd
party APIs
– Authentication methods
– Multi-Threading of function calls
– bat Scripts for easier running of scripts for the client
Models used
Python Frameworks like requests to build own custom client for consumption of APIs.
Skills used
Python Programming, Mult-threading, APIs
Databases used
The client provided a MySQL instance.
Web Cloud Servers used
Zoho
What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?
– Writing own client-side API-consumption code handling API calls from Authentication and Other Operations as per task requirements.
– Debugging of API responses was messy.
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
– Multiple alternatives were discussed and implemented in python like conditional refreshing of API tokens.
– Automation of daily synchronization handled by use of time deltas.
– Logging of all operations to efficiently handle errors in the future.
Business Impact
– Automated workflow of the client
– No need for dull tasks like data entry to CRM modules everything is taken care of using logic.
