How the Technical Challenges were Solved
Solution:
To Fetch the data from CRM. We used Zapier. It is connector between two applications so that whenever a particular incident happen it will populate into another application. We use Zapier to connect CRM and Google sheets so that whenever a new lead will change or modified data will be stored into google sheets.
Data in google sheets was uncleaned. First, we connect the Google sheet with PowerbI then perform EDA to clean the data using DAX language.
Using merging of two tables by ONE-ON-ONE schema we solve duplicate entries of a particular lead in PowerBI.
