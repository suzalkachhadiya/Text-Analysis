The Problem
Traffic Signals are inefficient because even if there are no cars or no pedestrians on the road it still works on a timer and stops the traffic or pedestrian unnecessarily.
Our Solution
We provide a Computer vision-logic to Manipulate the traffic signal to work such that it turns red only when x number of pedestrians are waiting to cross the signal.
Solution Architecture
Yolov7 pose estimation
Opencv
Deliverables
The program Detects Pedestrians and Gives alerts to traffic Signals to turn Red or stay Green.
