project objective
confirmation  identification of data that can be used  obtained without bias
understanding the actions that are required to be performed post analytics
converting the data into metrics using formulae that can be used to conduct the analysis
project description
it is a culture management platform that uses learning as the fundamental mode of communication the platform requires an analytics portion that captures a variety of data related to the interaction of the learner with content assessments engagements and forums to create personalized learning plans for each user to increase the effectiveness of learning and its retention which together make an impact on the overall productivity of the learner and the organization
our solution
we helped the client in deciding the data required for the analysis process we came up with the appropriate models for various tasks and interpretations of how the data will be collected and analysed for the initial response final response retention proficiency and learning intent of the user we designed the models in such a way that one can perform seamlessly grading for each question type based on difficulty level and at a different hierarchical level subsection section training and so on we knew that each user has its unique aptitude level basic intermediate and advanced and keeping that in my mind we incorporated those aptitude levels in our analytics too moreover we integrated the grade and time factor into the analysis so that more points are allotted for comparatively tough questions and quick responses respectively

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
data analytics is all about analysing and finding patterns in the data that already exist or are getting generated in realtime however this project is in the budding stage and we had no data to start our analysis moreover this project is novel and the dataset that meets our requirements was nearly impossible to find online
how the technical challenges were solved
we performed data simulation techniques and tried to generate the data as authentic as possible using some libraries in python and random functions in spreadsheets we also generated the data manually at a small scale but we made sure that we are including every human factor in it
