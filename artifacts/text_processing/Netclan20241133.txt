project objective
build a fully integrated bi platform in powerbi using native connectors and apisquickbooks and airtable to pull real time data from many sources
project description
for building a fully integrated bi platform  the data has to come from the following sources to feed it to powerbi 

quickbooks 
an accounting software that accepts realtime business payments   manage and pay bills manage organisations depositsexpenses  customers and payroll functions the following datatables has to be fetched from quickbooks 
o   customer
o   invoices
o   product  services
o   payments
o   expenses
o   deposits
o   accounts
o   vendors
o   departments
o   classes

airtable 
an online database hybrid platform for creating and sharing relational databases with friendly user interfaces the following databases with multiple data table has to be fetched from airtable 
o   marketing data analytics base google ads  facebook ads
o   payroll tracking payroll  hours log
this quickbook and airtable real time data has to go to the powerbi service 
httpsapppowerbicom
 then create useful visualisation and dashboards based on plan and feedback from the executive team all visuals in dashboards should automatically update without any intervention to make it fully integrated
our solution
collecting data tables from data sources 
data pipelinequickbooks to airtable
 we have built a data pipeline in python that uses quickbooks api
httpspypiorgprojectpythonquickbooks
 to get raw data tables from quickbooks and uses airtable api 
httpsapiairtablecomvbasekeytablenameapikeyyourapikey
 to writeupdate data in airtable it fetches all the below raw tables after making requests to quickbooks api 
customers  invoices  expenses  deposits
accounts  departments  vendors etc
after getting these raw data tables  pipeline converts it into dataframe  then writesupdates it into airtable
the pipeline is deployed in a server that runs every night  it fetches the data from quickbooks api and writesupdates to airtable
airtable to powerbi
 as there is no connector available to sync data from airtable to powerbi we have used pagination using dax queries to get data from web sources ie airtable api pagination fetches the data page by page  using a source and offset technique set by the airtable api developers it successfully fetches all the below bases from airtable api 
marketing data analytics data google ads  facebook ads
payroll data payroll  hours log
scheduled refresh 
to refresh visualizationdashboard if incoming data from airtable api has updated  set refresh time in powerbi service
preprocessing of  data 
we have used dax queries to prepare and process the raw data coming from airtable like 
split data  typecast data
filter data fill missing values  delete irrelevant rows etc
create visualizationsdashboards
 we have used following techniques to create visualizations 
used m code queries to extract usefuldesired data
used measure to perform calculations on data
use a calculated table to create a relationship between two tables
used data joining union  intersection to get desired data
project deliverables

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
quickbooks refresh token expired issue
 as stated in quickbooks developer guide  we need refresh token to access quickbooks api and it expires after  days but that is not the case  it usually expires within  to  days depending on how frequently we access the api in that case our deployed pipeline does not work if the token expired
getting data from airtable to powerbi
 as powerbi has no airtable data source connector to fetch data from airtable  we did use web source connector using airtable data web links it only fetches the st page that is  rows from airtable base because airtable api gives only  rowsrequest
dynamic data source refresh issue
  as the url of airtable bases data changes based on the size of data powerbi recognizes it as dynamic data source  hence it gives the error dynamic data source refresh error in powerbi service
how the technical challenges were solved
quickbooks refresh token expired issue
  as the token may expire anytime after  days  so to resolve this we have added a gui element in pipeline so that if token expires a pop up will appear asking for a new refresh token  until the consumer enters a valid new token from their quickbook developer account  a pop up will keep coming and pipeline will be paused once the user enters a new token  the pipeline will continue working
getting data from airtable to powerbi
 to resolve this issue  we have used pagination technique as below 
first request airtable api with proper url  apikey and blankoffset dataurlapikeyapikeyoffsetblankoffset
this request returns first  rows of data and a new offset value
now replace the previous offset value with a new offset value in the url  and again make an api request
this request will return the next  rows of data and a new offset
do this until you get a null offset null offset means  all data has been fetched
this is how we get all the data of any size from airtable bases
dynamic data source refresh issue
 the above mentioned pagination technique converts dynamic urls of airtable bases data into static urls so powerbi gives no error as it has been converted to a static data source now the client can refresh the dashboard manually by clicking the refresh button or can set automatic refresh daily at some given time
