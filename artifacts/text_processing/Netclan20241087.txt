the problem
the main problem that was addressed in this project was the manual calculation of return on advertising spend roas due to the lack of a centralized platform for running ads the clients ads were spread across multiple revenue generating platforms including google adsense adx and ezoic while the spending was managed through the google ads platform at that time the client lacked a centralized dashboard or website that could effectively calculate roas by integrating revenue and cost streams this fragmentation made it challenging for the client to track and evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns therefore a comprehensive solution was developed and implemented providing a centralized platform for calculating roas aligning revenue and cost data from various sources and enabling informed decisionmaking regarding advertising investments
our solution
we developed a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating return on advertising spend roas and centralizing their advertising data the solution involved collecting data from four different apis google ads api for spending data google adsense api ad manager api and ezoic data for revenue data to ensure compatibility we utilized an extract transform load etl tool to convert the data received from each api which was in different formats into a standardized format storing them pandas dataframe for both revenue and spending data
the transformed data was then stored in a postgres database for easy access and management to automate the data extraction process we implemented an etl script that runs twice daily via cronjob on a digital ocean vm ensuring the latest data is always available
moreover we designed a backend api using the flask framework this api fetched the required data from the postgres db allowing users to retrieve relevant information efficiently
finally we implemented a roas dashboard frontend to display the calculated roas using the fetched values the dashboard provided a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to track and monitor their advertising performance with our solution in place the client could now easily monitor roas over time access consolidated data and make informed decisions regarding their advertising investments
solution architecture
the solution architecture involved a multistep process to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating roas and centralizing their advertising data data was collected from various apis including google ads api google adsense api ad manager api and ezoic data and transformed into a standardized format using an etl tool
the transformed data was stored in a postgres database and a backend api was developed using the flask framework to fetch the required data the calculated roas was then displayed on a next js dashboard providing users with an intuitive interface to track and analyze their advertising performance

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
some of the technical challenges encountered were
ensuring data integrity during the transformation process
deployment of docker image on vm
setting up an automated etl pipeline
adding ssl certificate to backend api
how the technical challenges were solved
 ensuring data integrity implemented checks cleansing and validation to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data
 docker image deployment on vm configured vm to support docker image for etl and deployed the image for seamless execution
 setting up automated etl pipeline automated data extraction transformation and loading processes for efficient data management via cronjob
 adding ssl certificate to backend api secured backend api with ssl certificate enabling encrypted communication for enhanced data protection
business impact
the implemented solution had a significant positive impact on the clients business by providing a centralized platform for calculating roas and integrating data from multiple revenuegenerating platforms the client gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns the availability of realtime consolidated data enabled informed decisionmaking regarding advertising investments the userfriendly interface of the raos dashboard allowed the client to easily track and monitor their advertising performance leading to improved campaign optimization and potentially higher returns on advertising spend overall the solution streamlined the clients advertising operations resulting in increased efficiency and improved business outcomes
