project objective
for all  cases use a random number generator that will give you numbers between   a million Â  whatever generator you use make sure to adjust the numbers so that they are between    distributed randomly
for all tasks we will have  colors for example in task  when the random number selected is between    choose a bright color that is easily visible i have called it br clr  for numbers between    choose another bright color br clr  for numbers between    choose b blue for numbers between    choose r red and   choose g green simulate these  task scenarios and represent them in a table  x  and collect statistics at the end replicate the simulation exercises for each task with  different initial seed numbers likewise for  other tasks
our solution
task involves creating  excel files running a python script in jupyter notebook which contains certain integer ranges indicating certain values and some other criteria the random number range  to  million
there are  different tasks which have different conditions based on which need to form simulate these  tasks and represent them in a table  x  and collect statistics at the end replicating the simulation exercises for each task with  different initial seed numbers
then using the find and replace tab of excel to make it in the correct format with proper color data representation in particular format and formatting colors text based on condition passed within excel

formatting excel files
discovered a lot of shortcuts available within excel to deal with data representation in particular format and learned about formatting colors text based on condition passed within excel
replication and selecting rows and columns with shortcuts and in simplest way possible transposing selected data and many more
