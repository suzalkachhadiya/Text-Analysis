client background
overview
as a singapore and australia based startup drive lah known as drive mate in australia is a peertopeer car sharing platform where you can rent a large variety of cars always nearby at great value all trips on drive lah are comprehensively insured through our insurance partners so car owners dont have to worry about their insurance the idea is simple car ownership is expensive in singapore per month yet only use the car  of the time  cars are mostly parked with drive lah you can reduce the cost of ownership by renting it out when you dont need it in a safe way renters can rent those cars when they are not used by their owners at good value

our solution
for performance metrics we suggested that we will code for each metric  will store them in a table on aws rds which will be directly synced to the aws quick sight for performance evaluations
