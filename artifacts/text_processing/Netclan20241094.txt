project description
we need to create a notebook with solutions to binary classificationrelated anomaly detection problems we need to use machine learning and deep learning models which have greater than  accuracy
our solution
we created a notebook for anomaly detection we used  to  machine learning and deep learning models but onlyÂ   different types of auto encoder models that were giving greater than  accuracy we trained all  models on one classification data which have anomalies and evaluated trained models on test data
project deliverables
a notebook that has solutions for anomaly detection related classification problems and accuracy should be above 
tools used
google colab notebooks tensorflow google drive
languagetechniques used
python programming language machine learning deep learning data analysis and data visualization
models used
auto encoder and variational auto encoder
skills used
python data analysis data visualization machine learning deep learning
databases used
ms excel
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
most of the anomaly detection models work with regression type data and this problem was classification problem so we need to deal with classification data
getting high accuracy is also a tough challenge for us because there are only a few models which work well on anomaly detection related classification problems
how the technical challenges were solved
so we have limited models for this problem so we used only classification models like autoencoders isolation forest and one class svm
only autoencoder was giving high accuracy so we worked with different types of autoencoders like variational autoencoder and normal autoencoder
