project objective
create a machine learning solution to manage electricity for electric vehicles
main tasks
percentage probability of  user plugin his vehicle today by users plugin date history
reduce the probability of plugin time according to users plugin time history
project description
we need to calculate the date and time probability that the user will plugin his vehicle today based on his plugin date and plugin time history we also need to decrease time probability based on the users past time range
our solution
we converted the users plugin data into binary values like  if the user hasnt pluggedin his vehicle on that day and  if he pluggedin we identified the driven distance based on the amount of charge used between two plugin times then we trained the ridge regression ml model for identifying each day driven kilometer from these kilometres we have identified the probability that users will plugin today and it will increase day by day till the user does not plugin his vehicle
for time probability we have used probability distribution function pdf and cumulative distribution function  cdf these functions will decrease probability according to the users time range
project deliverables
 python scripts to
train regression model every day
use model weights to generate probability values
tools used
google colab vs code google drive and ms excel
languagetechniques used
python programming language data analytics with numpy and pandas data visualization with matplotlib statistics and mathematics machine learning with sklearn
models used
ridge regression model
skills used
data analytics data visualization machine learning python statistics
databases used
local data from ms excel sheet
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
there are a lot of challenges faced during project execution
at the start we have only imaginary data so need to convert in a good format to apply machine learning models
find the best machine learning model for the data
decrease the time probability according to users time range
how the technical challenges were solved
we have converted the data into weekdays binary values like marked  if not pluggedin vehicle on that day and  if plugged and calculated driven distance by amount of charge used between two plugin dates
tried different regression based machine learning models like random forest regressor xgboost regressor ridge regression and checked accuracies of all models and choosed best one
for decreasing time probability we used probability distribution function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf these functions decrease probability according to the users time range
