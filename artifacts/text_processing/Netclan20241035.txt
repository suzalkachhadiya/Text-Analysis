the problem
perform analysis of all contributors profiles of solana and ethereum repository by collecting information through github api then perform analysis of all random  github users profile
our solution
to achieve this analysis first we need to extract each github users data these user data are retrieved from the most popular repository
these are the following features which will impact on good developer
from githubusername will fetch the all feature as follows  totalrepos  totalcontribution all repos  totalforks  totalstars  totalachievements  popularity  totalcodereview  totalissues  total comments
total repository
description this feature indicates the overall number of repositories owned by a github user
impact on good developer a good developer often has a varied and substantial collection of repositories showcasing their diverse skills and experiences a higher number of repositories may indicate a proactive approach to personal and collaborative projects
total commits
description the total count of commits made by the github user across all repositories
impact on good developer a higher number of commits suggests an active and consistent contribution to projects it reflects a strong work ethic and continuous engagement in coding activities
total repository forks
description the cumulative number of times repositories owned by the user have been forked by others
impact on good developer forks indicate that others find the developers projects valuable it can be a measure of the influence and usefulness of their code to the community
total stars achieved
description the total number of stars received across all repositories
impact on good developer stars signify appreciation and popularity a higher star count suggests that the developers work is recognized and admired by the github community
total issue raise
description the overall count of issues raised by the user in various repositories
impact on good developer actively participating in issue tracking demonstrates collaboration and problemsolving skills a good developer not only writes code but also engages in discussions and issue resolution
total code review
description the number of code reviews conducted by the user
impact on good developer engaging in code reviews indicates a commitment to maintaining code quality and collaborating effectively with team members
total commits per repository
description average number of commits per repository owned by the user
impact on good developer this metric gives insights into the developers commitment to individual projects a wellmaintained and actively developed repository may reflect a higher level of expertise and dedication
total addition per repository
description average lines of code added per repository
impact on good developer this provides insights into the depth of contributions to individual projects a good developer not only contributes but does so in a meaningful and impactful way
total deletion per repository
description average lines of code deleted per repository
impact on good developer while deletions are necessary an excessive average deletion count might indicate a need for improvement in initial code quality a balanced approach to code maintenance is crucial
total stars per repository
description average number of stars received per repository
impact on good developer this metric helps gauge the overall popularity and impact of individual projects a higher average star count reflects wellreceived and valuable work
total forks per repository
description average number of times repositories are forked
impact on good developer a higher average fork count indicates that the developers projects are considered as starting points for other projects showcasing their influence and contribution to the opensource community

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
fetching all the github features from github api was a timeconsuming process
how the technical challenges were solved
i solved this problem by parallel processing and creating checkpoints to save the data collected if the api limit was exceeded
business impact
analyzing the profiles of contributors to solana and ethereum repositories through the github api and conducting a similar assessment of random  github users provides critical insights for strategic decisionmaking community engagement and resource optimization this analysis enables the identification of key contributors assessment of project quality and sustainability and efficient allocation of resources based on diverse skill sets it mitigates risks associated with dependency on a few contributors aids talent acquisition and retention and benchmarks the platforms competitiveness additionally it guides innovation and compliance measures and ensures business continuity by proactively addressing potential disruptions overall this indepth analysis serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the vitality innovation and longevity of blockchain projects on solana and ethereum
