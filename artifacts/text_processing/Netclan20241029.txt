the problem
our client a leading research institution faced challenges in collecting rich engaging data through traditional survey methods participants often found surveys tedious and uninteresting leading to low response rates and limited insights additionally the client sought a way to accommodate participants who preferred verbal communication over written responses
our solution
to address these challenges proposed integrating generative ai technology into the qualtrics platform this would allow for dynamic aidriven conversations with participants making the survey experience more interactive and personalized additionally we suggested implementing speechtotext functionality to cater to participants who preferred vocalizing their responses
solution architecture
in solution involved integrating chatgpt and gemini ai models into the qualtrics environment participants could engage in conversations with the ai either by typing or speaking their prompts speech inputs were processed using geminis speechtotext capabilities enabling seamless interaction with the ai models

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
realtime integration
achieving seamless realtime integration of ai models with qualtrics proved challenging due to the asynchronous nature of the platforms
speechtotext accuracy
ensuring accurate transcription of speech inputs posed a technical challenge especially in noisy environments or with accented speech
how the technical challenges were solved
how the technical challenges were solved
simulated ai model
to overcome realtime integration challenges we implemented a simulated ai model that generated personalized responses based on user prompts
enhanced speech processing
we finetuned geminis speechtotext capabilities to improve accuracy and robustness enabling reliable transcription of verbal inputs
business impact
improved participant engagement
the implementation of aidriven conversations led to higher participant engagement and increased survey completion rates
richer data collection
participants provided more detailed and nuanced responses leading to richer datasets and deeper insights for the clients research initiatives
