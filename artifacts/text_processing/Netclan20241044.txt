the problem
the client aimed to develop a sophisticated sports prediction model capable of forecasting game outcomes across five major sports leagues ncaafb nhl nfl nba and mlb the primary challenge was to leverage historical data and statistical inputs to accurately predict game winners the project required integrating data from the sportradar api processing it efficiently and utilizing machine learning techniques to train a predictive model the ultimate goal was to provide realtime predictions that could assist in sports betting strategies or enhance fan engagement
our solution
the proposed solution involved creating a comprehensive sports prediction model using python leveraging the sportradar api for data acquisition and storing the data in google cloud storage the project was structured around a modular approach with each sport having its dedicated script sportnamepy for data processing and model training the development workflow included
 data collection utilizing the sportradar api to gather historical data for the past  seasons
 data processing storing the data in google cloud storage and processing it into a structured format suitable for model training
 model training preparing the data for model training focusing on converting json data to tabular format and fetching relevant team stats
 prediction developing the predictive model to forecast game outcomes based on historical data and statistical inputs

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
data collection and storage collecting data for the past  seasons schedules team stats and game stats from the sportradar api and storing it in gcp was a significant challenge
data processing processing the raw data to create a dataframe and augmenting it with necessary statistics was another challenge
model training training the model with the processed data to predict game outcomes was a complex task due to the vast amount of data and the need for accurate predictions
how the technical challenges were solved
data collection and storage the data was collected through the sportradar api and stored in a google cloud storage bucket named dataparlayy the gcp client was configured using a service account json key obtained from an environment variable gcsserviceaccountjsonkey
data processing the raw data was processed through various steps to create a dataframe and augment it with necessary statistics
model training the model training involves converting game summary and statistics data from json to tabular format fetching team stats and past game stats the team stats and past few games stats are already processed and ready for training
business impact
the implementation of the sports prediction model has the potential to significantly impact the sports betting and fan engagement industries by providing accurate predictions of game outcomes the model can assist in sports betting strategies or fan engagement activities by providing great insights this can lead to improved decisionmaking processes increased operational efficiency and strategic planning within the sports betting and fan engagement industries
the sports prediction model project by kason karangwa is a significant step towards leveraging data science and machine learning to predict sports outcomes the project not only addresses the technical challenges of data collection processing and model training but also has the potential to significantly impact the sports betting and fan engagement industries with the successful completion of the project kason karangwa has demonstrated the power of data science in predicting sports outcomes setting a new standard for sports prediction models
