project objective
project sentimental analysis on shareholder letter of companies objective was to predict the sentiments columns shareholder letter in terms of polarity and subjectivity finally classification of data into positive negative and neutral tone
project description
the project sentimental analysis on shareholder letter of us companies task involved data cleaning on shareholder letters of different companies which includes lemmatization lower case conversion removing special character n  t  punctuations numbers  single character and tokenization to generate polarity and subjectivity columns for the letter   letter  columns using the textblob library of nltk based on the polarity categorizing it into positive neutral    negative
our solution
letter text length variation
contraction mapping on dataset
replacing missing value with some neutral tone string like none so that cleaning doesnt generate any issue
data cleaning and preprocessing which involves 
i  lemmatisation
ii lower case conversion
iii  removing special character
iv  removing n  t etc
v  remove punctuations numbers  single character removal
vi  forming list of letter data using tqdm
tokenization and word count
used textblob library which is part of nltk for sentiment analysis
created polarity and subjectivity column for the letter  letter columns
based on the polarity of letter  created a lettertype column with values positive  neutral    negative category

models used
my project sentimental analysis on shareholder letter of companies developed with a software model which makes the project high quality reliable and cost effective
 software model  waterfall model
 for project sentimental analysis on shareholder letter of us companies is a waterfall model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start using textblob which predicts sentiments polarity and subjectivity as the output following the waterfall model
skills used
pandas operations
data chunking and integration
data visualization
databases used
no database is used to complete this project
web cloud servers used
no web cloud server was required for this work
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
i have worked before on tasks similar to this so there were no challenges faced but the data cleaning was a bit different and required time to complete
how the technical challenges were solved
as discussed no technical challenges were faced during this project

figure  sample input dataset
figure  is pandas dataframe which was fetched from google cloud database there were  columns and  rows
figure  sample output dataset
figure  is output pandas dataframe after data cleaning and modeling of sentiment identification there are  columns and  rows
figure  sentiments assignment based on polarity
figure  represents the identification of sentiments and tone based on polarity and subjectivity polarity then sentiment type is positive  if the polarity sentiment type is negative and if the polarity sentiment type is neutral
