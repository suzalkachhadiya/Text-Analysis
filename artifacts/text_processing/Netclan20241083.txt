project objective
brodie johnco had a mongodb database that he wanted to connect to a power bi dashboard however odbc connectors were not working for his level of subscription so he needed a cheaper workaround
project description
brodie johnco had a mongodb database containing a large amount of data that he wanted to visualize in a power bi dashboard he initially tried to use odbc connectors to connect his database to power bi but ran into issues due to his level of subscription we were brought in to help find a cheaper workaround
our solution involved using python to extract the relevant data from brodies mongodb database we used the pandas library to create dataframes which we then uploaded to azure blob storage as tables we set up an azure pipeline that ran a python script every  minutes to update the tables with new data from the database
our solution
we used brodies mongodb database keys to extract relevant data clusters as pandas dataframes we then added them as tables to azure blob storage and set up a python script to an azure pipeline that refreshed every  minutes this allowed us to keep the data in sync and provide brodie with uptodate information for his power bi dashboard
project deliverables
the final deliverable was a readable csv file that contained the converted data from the original json format
tools used
jupyter notebook google colab power bi mongodb compass microsoft excel azure blob storage
languagetechniques used

mongodb database
web cloud servers used
azure blob storage
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the main challenge we faced was finding a way to connect brodies mongodb database to his power bi dashboard without using odbc connectors we overcame this challenge by using python and azure blob storage to extract and store the relevant data
how the technical challenges were solved
we solved the issue by using the clients mongodb database keys to extract relevant data clusters as pandas dataframes we then added these dataframes as tables to azure blob storage and set the python script to an azure pipeline that refreshed every  minutes this allowed the client to access the data in power bi without the need for odbc connectors
business impact
our solution allowed brodie to visualize his data in a power bi dashboard without having to pay for expensive odbc connectors the azure blob storage solution we implemented was much more costeffective and provided him with uptodate information every  minutes
