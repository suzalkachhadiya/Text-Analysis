project description
the main challenge faced by the team was the integration of the two systems themselves
since onebyone entering of records into each module is a mundane task and a waste of valuable time we proposed the automation using apis
our solution
the challenge was divided into two milestones and subtasks for each
 first was the ingestion of existing data into the cloudbased crm platform
 second was the question of automating the process of adding newer records to the cloud platform
project deliverables
the client has been provided with python scripting handling bulk data ingestion to crm and also the script to handle daily synchronization of data
tools used
 python
 mysql database
 postman
 teamviewer
languagetechniques used
 automation
 
rd

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
 writing own clientside apiconsumption code handling api calls from authentication and other operations as per task requirements
 debugging of api responses was messy
how the technical challenges were solved
 multiple alternatives were discussed and implemented in python like conditional refreshing of api tokens
 automation of daily synchronization handled by use of time deltas
 logging of all operations to efficiently handle errors in the future
business impact
 automated workflow of the client
 no need for dull tasks like data entry to crm modules everything is taken care of using logic
