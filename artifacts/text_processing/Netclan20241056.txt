application architecture
below is the overview of the architecture for an ai audiotoaudio chatbot application leveraging openai whisper and elevenlabs texttospeech tts api
physical input voice recording
the user provides a spoken input through a microphone
pyaudio library is used to record the audio input saving it as a wav file
transcribe
the recorded wav file is fed into openai whisper for speechtotext transcription
gpt turbo
the transcribed text is passed to gpt turbo a large language model finetuned for various tasks
gpt turbo generates a response text based on the input
display response
the generated response text is displayed for the user to read
speech synthesis
the response text is sent to elevenlabs tts api for texttospeech synthesis
the api synthesizes the text into an audio file which can be in wav or mp format
play the response audio
the synthesized audio file is played back for the user to hear
