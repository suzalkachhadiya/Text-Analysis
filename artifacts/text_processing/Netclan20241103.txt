project objective
get statistics such as uptimeÂ  availability cpu throughput etc from auvik and connectwise and make a dashboard from it in grafana
project description
unlike many technologies for which plugins are readily available in grafana there are none for auvik and connectwise so our task was to device a solution through which all the data from auvik and connectwise can be fed to grafana this data then would be used to plot graphs in grafana
our solution
setup postgres on linux
create appropriate databases tables and users in it
use python to get data from auvik and connectwise and perform necessary preprocesing
in the same python file connect to our postgres database
ingest this data into postgres database
setup grafana
connect grafana to postgres using the postgres plugin
query our postgres database in grafana to get desired results
plot multiple graphs according to clients requirement and make a dashboard from it
project deliverables

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
since the data received from auvik was in json fromat our first approach was to use grafanas builtin json plugin but this wasnt working since the data received from auvik was multidimensional when the json plugin required one dimensional data
how the technical challenges were solved
the above challenge was addressed by transforming the multi dimensional data into one dimensional when it was store in a python variable this transformed data was then inserted into postgres
