project objective
creating a data pipeline to sync live data from fieldpulse to google data studio using gcpmysql
project description
there is a virtual machine up and running and mysql in google cloudgcp get the following live data from fieldpulse to google data studiogds for making business dashboard in gds 
job data
tag data
team member data
team data
such that if data changes in fieldpulse  gds dashboard should update automatically
our solution
for fetching data from fieldpulse 
data pipeline fieldpulse to gcp mysql
  we have created a data pipeline that uses web scraping to fetch data from fieldpulse it makes a get request to the fieldpulse api  and the api returns raw data convert this into json format then in dataframe now  create new tables in gcp mysql and insertupdate the data accordingly
insertion  updation of data 
insertion 
if any data fetched from fieldpulse is not present in their respective database table  then  insert that data in the table
updation 
if any data fetched from fieldpulse is present in their respective database table  then update that data in the table
deploy the above data pipeline in gcp vm instance
  deploy the above data pipeline in gcp vm so that data gets updated every hour from fieldpulse to mysql
for getting data from gcp mysql to google data studiogds 
connecting gcp mysql to google data studio
  connect gcp mysql to gds as follows 
open a new report
click on add data
choose mysql connector
enter following fields 
host name or ip  
xxxxxxxxxxxx
database

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
getting data from fieldpulse 
as there is no open source packagelibrary in python for accessing fieldpulse api  we struggled a lot to get the desired data from fieldpulse
setting up connection from gcp mysql to gds 
due to firewall and vpn  connection was not set up as ip address changes while using vpn it was showing an error every time someone tries to connect to mysql from their google studio account
how the technical challenges were solved
getting data from fieldpulse 
we did use web scraping for this we explored all the api addresses we connected to each possible address and got the data then explored the data made a list of addresses which contains data of our interest also data is stored in a scattered and cascaded manner in fieldpulse with ids so  we had to fetch a lot of extra tables and then join multiple tables to get a desired data table
setting up connection from gcp mysql to gds 
to resolve this issue  we did as below 
set up the ip address in gcp mysql security to   so that any system can access it vpn issue resolved
enabled the ssl in gcp mysql to prevent it from unauthorized access
