project objective
code for extraction of the price of cryptocurrency
required realtime data of cryptocurrency and this is extracted from the cryptocurrency url
forecast code for prediction of the price
built fastapi to reduce interaction complexity for the user
project description
etl and mlops infrastructure for blockchain analytics this entire project completes in  outlines and stages in the first segment data scraping for the price of the cryptocurrency the second stage is loading the data into the microsoft mysql server and transforming data into the required shape for the automated process data load into the amazon rds tool management service which knows as the amazon relational database service and creating db instances db instance class  dbtsmall


in the fourth stage built the fastapi for the get data to the fingertips and easily accessible for the client because it reduces the time to fetch the price of a particular cryptocurrency with a single click and increases the efficiency of understanding
our solution
this project module develops according to the clients requirements which involves data extraction of cryptocurrency data from a given url by the client it also changes the data format and attributes nomenclature according to the requirements after extracting the data its loads into microsoft mysql server for the transformation of data and for full automation process used amazon rds and built the fastapi
