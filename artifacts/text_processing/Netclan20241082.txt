project objective
the objective of this project was to build a physics informed neural network pinn using tensorflow which could evaluate circuits based on the parameters provided through a matlab simulation
project description
mohamed provided us with a dataset generated from a matlab simulation of a circuit consisting of various input parameters and the corresponding circuit performance outputs we were tasked with developing a machine learning model that could accurately predict circuit performance based on the input parameters while also incorporating the underlying physics principles that govern circuit behavior
our solution
our team utilized jupyter notebook google colab octave and matlab to build the pinn we used tensorflow models to build the neural network and microsoft excel to clean and preprocess the data our team employed python programming tensorflow pandas and matlab skills to build the pinn we did not use any databases for this project nor did we use any webcloud servers
project deliverables
the final deliverable was a functional pinn capable of evaluating circuits based on the provided parameters
tools used
our team used jupyter notebook google colab octave matlab and microsoft excel
languagetechniques used
the primary languages and techniques we used were python programming tensorflow and matlab
models used
we used tensorflow models to build the neural network for the pinn
skills used
our team utilized python programming tensorflow pandas and matlab skills to build the pinn
databases used
we did not use any databases for this project
web cloud servers used
we did not use any webcloud servers for this project
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the project was very challenging since our team did not have a background in electrical engineering it was difficult to understand the physics behind the circuit evaluation and we faced issues when using matlab to provide data for the project
how the technical challenges were solved
we worked with the client to gain a better understanding of the physics behind the circuit evaluation we also worked with matlab experts to help us better understand how to provide data for the project
business impact
the pinn we built for mohamed zamil allowed for efficient circuit evaluation and improved the overall accuracy of the evaluation process
