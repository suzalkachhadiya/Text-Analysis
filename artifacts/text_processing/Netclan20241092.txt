project objective
classify the medical research paper into  if the medical research paper cannot be used in future medical research and  if the medical research paper can be used in research based on some researchrelated phrases
train an mldl model on classified data
project description
we have given an excel sheet of medical research paper text and provided some phrases to identify research papers that can be used for future medical research if the phrase is not present in a research paper then it will not be used for research after annotation we need to find the best mldl model to train research data and evaluate the model on test data
our solution
we have created a python script that can compare all medical research paper text to research phrases and annot  if research phrases are not present in a medical research paper and  if research phrases present in medical research paper
after annotation we have trained different machine learning and deep learning models like bert base uncased using tensorflow bert large xgboost classifier random forest classifier and logistic regression among these models we have chosen the best accuracy  parameters model in our case the bertbase model performed good and gave  test accuracy

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
there are various technical challenges faced during project execution
the research paper has a huge amount of text data so the model was giving space errors in colab notebooks
find the best threshold value which gives best test accuracy
how the technical challenges were solved
to solve space error we have trained the model with lower batch size so this solved the error
to find the best threshold value we created the roc auc curve and precision  recall curve and checked best points where accuracy will be higher
