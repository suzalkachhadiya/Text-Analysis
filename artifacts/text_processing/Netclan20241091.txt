the problem
have an existing python model that has been built for the analysis of sectorspecific stock etfs for investment purposes need to update the existing selection criteria to adjust the selection filter and add a screening criterion that drops off one or more of the proposed holdings and to have the ability to adjust the parameters of the selection criteria to test different variables
our solution
the  in  fundamental model screens a fundamental ranking of stock market sectors picks the top ranked holding and continues to hold that sector as long as it remains in the top four rankings  the model holds two positions at a time  the sector ranking data is in the wcmxlxs file  we input data from the pricescsv file to pull up monthly returns  when i go to run the program i use the innewpy and that give me the current rankings for both the fundamental and technical rankings
sometimes a sector is ranked as being fundamentally attractive because it has become cheaper because of problems going on within an industry  what i would like to do is to test out a way of screening out a sector based upon poor performance over a lookback period  here is what the new model would do
screen for a the specific number of sectors probably between three and five based upon the fundamental ranking over an average time period currently  weeks
choose either three four or five holdings
exclude the holding that has the weakest performance over a specify lookback period lets start with  weeks but i would like to be able to adjust this variable
compare the performance of various combinations seeing the return on an annual basis if possible as well as showing the maximum drawdown
solution architecture
deliverables
an updated optimised python script that will filter and return technical and financial holdings with a price filter that will do price analysis on a certain lookback period
tools used
numpy
pandas
itertools
combinations
permutations
languagetechniques used
python
business impact
the client now can get more than  financial and technical holdings  up to maximum  holdings for both technical and financial plus the holdings were more accurate because of the new added price filter that will exclude the holding that has the weakest performance over a specify lookback period default  weeks it boosted the clients profit because of the more accurate and optimised functional filters
