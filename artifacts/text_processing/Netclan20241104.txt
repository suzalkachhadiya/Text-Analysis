project objective
migrate existing databases from postgres to elastic search since elasticserach performs better in search operations in addition to this all of the backend javascript also needed to be changed in order to query the new elasticsearch database
project description
the clients website was a visualization tool it also had gui to add filters to make the visualizations at least  records needed to be pulled from the postgres database whose size would be around mbs this would take a lot of time nearly  secs adding filters would take additional time so our task was to move the entire database over to elasticsearch from postgres since it is way more faster in search operations and also filtering data since the database was changed we also had to write new backend code that would now query the elasticsearch database
our solution
setup elk stack elasticsearch logstash kibana on aws ec instance
write a pipeline file conf file which is used to ingest data from postgres to elasticsearch the datatypes of cloumns unique constraints datetime formats etc are all defined in this file this is executed with the help of logstash
once the data is inserted it can be queried in the kibanas built in query compiler here we can check the veracity of the data
identify the code in the backend that needs to be changed
replace this code with new code that would now query elasticserach we use elasticquerybuilder module for this
testing postgres and elasticsearch performance

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
sometimes for large responses from elasticsearch  size above mb time taken was above  secs
how the technical challenges were solved
to solve the above mentioned problem we used gzip in the request urls header this significantly reduced the execution times
business impact
earlier postgres infrastructure which took around  secs now too consistently less than  secs to perform filter and search operations this would contribute to a better user experience
