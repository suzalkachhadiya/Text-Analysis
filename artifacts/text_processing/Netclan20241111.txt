project objective
to scrape all the desired information regarding the nfts from a website and store them in a database to be accessed later on
project description
matthew brown  extract all events all time from this
httpslooksrareorgexploreactivity
 we can then pay you weekly to keep them up to date you can choose any technology you like as long as its updated into an sql database additional tasks may be to make an alert or dashboard from data later access api when it becomes available
our solution
we provided a robust solution which returned the nft data every  hours into the google big query database to do this we used selenium web driver to scrape all events as the website was dynamic and did not have a format data structure to scrape data using ajax post calls after automating the scarper the data was manipulated and constructed into a desired format into pandas dataframe which was later used to push the dataframe into the google big query database using google cloud api and credentials the data was getting collected every day and about m distinct rows were created

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the only technical challenge faced during this project was that the website used to keep changing the elements on their webpage and used to cause error though it did not use to happen regularly it happened  times in  weeks also ajax calls were not proper
how the technical challenges were solved
identifying the elements solved the issue also remote access to a better desktop enabled me to keep working as well as keep the code running all the time
business impact
supplied upto  million rows data regarding nfts
provided a python solution with optimal functions and code to be used and automate them to save the data into a database on a daily basis
caused a huge influx of data which can be used to make many insightful decisions regarding the nft market
