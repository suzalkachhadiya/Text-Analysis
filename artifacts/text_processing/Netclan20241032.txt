organization size

the problem
create a cloudbased solution where clients can upload datasets use draganddrop functionality to select columns for data modeling and receive the analysis results the data analysis will be conducted using the openai api except for the mixed model which will be handled manually then later user can do the simulation to get the insight of the dataset
our solution
develop a webbased application using frameworks like react for the frontend and nodejs for the backend establish secure methods for database access and data handling initially run statistical analyses using python and update the interface with results including mean auc mean accuracy mean loglikelihood coefficients with pvalues intercept bic aic ypred ytest and xtest allow users to visualize the dataset with different charts such as heatmaps line charts and actual vs predicted values over time automate these analyses by integrating python scripts with the backend deploy the application on google cloud ensuring the solution supports different user roles and permissions with robust testing and scalable infrastructure provide features for users to perform simulations and gain insights based on the analysis results

api endpoints and descriptions
test api
purpose
fetch payload data and perform various data modeling tasks
modeling types
logistic ordinal nominal poisson regression multiple models and mixed models
details
this api retrieves the dataset from mongodb applies the specified statistical models and returns the results
data api
purpose
store the output from the test api in mongodb
details
this api takes the modeling results from the test api and stores them in a specified mongodb collection for future reference and analysis
remove api
purpose
delete stored outputs from mongodb
details
this api deletes specific records or datasets previously stored in mongodb by the data api based on provided criteria or identifiers
mixedmodelidentify api
purpose
identify datasets suitable for mixed model analysis
details
this api analyzes the dataset to determine if it is appropriate for mixed model applications identifying key variables and structure
typeofcolumn api
purpose
identify the types of columns in the dataset
details
this api examines the dataset to determine the data types eg categorical ordinal integer real of each column which aids in data preprocessing and modeling decisions
tech stack
tools used
google cloud vscode mongodb
languagetechniques used
flask framework python language mongodb as database openai api
models used
logistic model
purpose
binary classification eg yesno outcomes
details
predicts the probability of a binary response based on predictors

details
models categorical responses with no inherent order
poisson regression model
purpose
count data modeling eg event occurrences
details
models the count of events within a fixed interval
multiple regression model
purpose
multiple linear regression
details
predicts a continuous outcome using multiple predictors
mixed model
purpose

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution

generating rcode through chatgpt and executing it in the backend

integrating rcloud services with the backend is complex it involves setting up secure connections and ensuring compatibility with the existing infrastructure

prompt engineering

chatgpt often struggles to generate complex code that meets specific client requirements refining prompts to improve code quality requires significant trial and error

mixed model handling

due to the complexity and dynamic nature of mixed models using prompt engineering or manual methods is challenging this often requires expert intervention to ensure accuracy
how the technical challenges were solved
switching from r to python

we replaced r with python and executed scripts on google cloud platform gcp which provided better compatibility stability and ease of managing dependencies
improved prompt engineering

to ensure chatgpt generated accurate code we provided specific code snippets as templates for each task this guided the ai and improved the quality and consistency of the generated code
handling mixed models

we combined manual intervention with automated checks to manage the complexity of mixed models although initial results sometimes required corrections iterative testing and refinement helped improve accuracy
business impact
this is mainly used for healthcare field for data analysis enhancing decisionmaking efficiency and accuracy for users
