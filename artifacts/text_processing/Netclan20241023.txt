the problem
build a web application develop  deploy and maintain the system in the background and there will be more hospitals partnering with our organization utilizing this tool per our service offering which could lead to longterm working contracts with us if interested
the current project is a hippacompliant spa web application that will interface with hospital data dashboards involving discharged patients callnavigator utilizes an sftp server that is hosted in aws this allows our partner hospital to store patient discharge files directly to an s bucket
the application and dashboard are currently up and running and pulling information and data from our partner hospital however the project was rushed through initial development and there are several frontend features that need to be addressed or finetunedupgraded and functions added searchflag options and redirection to make the application more userfriendly dashboard accuracy there are deliverables such as reporting that is part of the project scope that was not developed but are considered a priority after the features and functionality are improved
according to the og developer a github account for our organization will need to be created and code uploaded to two separate projects  one for backend and one for frontend
let me know if this project would be something you would like to further discuss thank you so much for your time and consideration
more information from the og developer follows
developer should specifically know or be able to learn these specific aws features since they will be responsible for deployment and maintaining the system
for deployment the developer must
 modify aws security groups and target groups etc
 push code to product do not remove og developer accessnetwork connection
currently there are github actions created that will deploy the code if you set up the proper secrets github actions on feangular app with deploy code to our static s website as well as creations invalidations for cloudfront that bypasses the caching an ssh config link and key file are available
need to be able to pull reports on call info by unit by caller by diagnosis physician or across the hospital specifically on flags for medications conditions ect
 flags and marked issues also need to be represented on the facility dashboard page
 automate the import process of file from hospital
 set up or ability to set up hospital employees to log in with their blessing credentials single sign on
 flags thrown need to show up somewhere in call navigator and also be able to go into them and view patients and issues right now the only notification and way to view this is strictly through email
 ability to hover over icons on facility dashboard and see info and be able to click on info and have a page with that info pop up
 on the discharge tab when setting a filter we want that filter to stay set unless we change it right now if you set a filter and then go into a patient when you come back out the filter is not set anymore and you have to set all over again
