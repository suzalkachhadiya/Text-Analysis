organization size

the problem
the organization has some services like sales installs and services for many departments like drain plumbing excavation hvac and bath organization wants to track some kpis based on the given monthly target and tracking should be department wise or technician wise the dashboard will show tracking the pace of kpis so that they can understand how the organization is performing in each department in terms of number of jobs revenue etc and also they want to understand  how technicians are working to achieve their monthly target dashboard has two basic views  one for admin persons and one for users only when an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range department technician to see the progress of department and technicians when a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  autofiltering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard
scope of this project is limited to atoz dependable service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity
our solution
define attributes and entities that needed to determine all the kpis for tracking
group kpis in categories and subcategories for example as per work defined in organization can be divided into three main categories called service sales and install and each of these categories can be divided into  departments called drain bath hvac plumbing and excavation so any department will have the same kpis for the same  category you can refer the document   httpsdrivegooglecomfiledepqtbetvrkfdwkxqtejcnentxviewuspsharing
determine calculations for each kpis
design dashboard in looker studio and add components need to track those kpis and use those kpi calculations in dashboard to get actual and target values
determine the admin view and users view of the dashboard report and create a separate dashboard for users in admin create three pages service sales and install for users create  separate dashboard each belongs to one of the main category
add datasource for each of the main categories service sales and install assign these datasource to the correct page same data source will be reused in users dashboard
determine what type of charts needed to full fill the client requirement add them and configure accordingly
create embedded url and provide those to the developer team to use as iframe in the primary product wwwatozscoreboardcom
create a user filter parameter default params for the user dashboard and make this as json string and pass it to the embed url through backend code so when a user will log in to the web app they will see a filtered dashboard which will only show his filter data from data source

how the technical challenges were solved
dashboard has two basic views  one for admin persons and one for users only when an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range department technician to see the progress of department and technicians when a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  autofiltering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard
scope of this project is limited to atoz dependable service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity
