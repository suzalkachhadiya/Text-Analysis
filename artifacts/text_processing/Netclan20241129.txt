what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
data cleaning  the scraped that will be used by our sites is coming from different sources and also its nots that clean to be used by sites this is the very first problem every data scientist faced during the whole process
data merging   the data is scraped from around  sources thats why its very difficult to maintain the attributes that should be used by all the sources and we can get a clean and sufficient amount of data to process
data validation   there are many records that have null values and missing values that disturb the users experience a lot that should be handle with very care
how the technical challenges were solved
data cleaning   for data cleaning we used python data frame and pandas and data structure and handles the data cleaning and optimize our data for get correct data format and useful data
data merging    for data merging and data transformation we used pandas that help to get the appropriate data that can used further and also make python pipelines for future updation
data validation  for that data validation we use some fundamental property and feature selection thats help us to make the appropriate data format and records to be used in our sites
