the problem
in todays fastpaced digital environment automotive brands and dealerships demand personalized and dynamic online experiences that reflect their unique identities static web pages or dashboards that cannot be customized limit engagement fail to showcase specific brand elements and lead to lost opportunities a dynamic system that can adjust each pages look and feel based on the dealership or brands unique requirements is essential for maintaining consistency and increasing customer engagement
our solution
pdf to dashboard streamlining financial statements is a comprehensive solution designed to create a fully dynamic and customizable online experience key features include
dynamic customization
each page or section of the dashboard can be personalized according to the brands identity and the dealerships preferences logos color schemes and layout adapt dynamically to reflect specific branding guidelines
flask and reactbased system
our dashboard employs a robust architecture using flask for the backend and react with apexcharts for the frontend this combination ensures a seamless data flow efficient processing and a responsive user interface
financial statement integration
with over  financial formulas the system provides insights into key metrics like gross profit and fixed operations the metrics are dynamically generated based on the dealerships financial data extracted from pdfs via pdf plumber and optical character recognition ocr technology
pickle object storage
calculated variables are stored as pickle objects in a mongodb database ensuring efficient retrieval and manipulation of data
cloud hosting on aws
the solution is securely hosted on an aws instance providing scalability and availability for multiple dealerships and brands
backend flask

endpoints
 provide restful apis for data extraction processing and storage
data extraction module
 uses pdf plumber and ocr for extracting data from pdf statements

models used
optical character recognition ocr model

utilized to extract text from pdf files the ocr model is integral to converting scanned documents into machinereadable data we use pretrained ocr models optimized for financial statements to ensure accurate and efficient data extraction
custom financial calculation models

these models contain a collection of formulas specifically tailored for analyzing automotive financial statements they are used to compute metrics like gross profit fixed operations and other key financial indicators these models adapt dynamically to each dealerships data structure
skills used
backend development

the backend is built using flask which handles data processing api management and ensures secure data storage knowledge of python flask and restful api design was essential for developing robust data processing and serving endpoints
frontend development

the frontend is built using react and apexcharts providing a dynamic and userfriendly interface skills in javascript react and data visualization tools were necessary for creating a customizable dashboard with rich data visualizations
data extraction and processing

expertise in pdf plumber and ocr technologies was leveraged to extract accurate data from various pdf formats advanced data manipulation and cleaning were required to ensure data consistency across different dealership documents
database management

storing financial metrics in mongodb as pickle objects required skills in data modeling and optimization understanding of documentbased storage and efficient querying techniques was crucial
cloud infrastructure

setting up and managing the aws instance required knowledge of cloud computing security protocols and scalable hosting solutions
databases used
mongodb
web cloud servers used
aws
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
data inconsistency across pdfs

financial statements from different brands and dealerships varied significantly in layout and data structure making it difficult to standardize data extraction
text recognition errors in ocr

the optical character recognition ocr process sometimes struggled to accurately interpret certain scanned documents leading to errors in data extraction
realtime data processing

the need for realtime data processing to generate uptodate financial metrics placed considerable pressure on system architecture impacting performance
dynamic frontend personalization

adapting the dashboard dynamically to each dealerships branding required a highly modular frontend design
scalability and security

ensuring the system was secure and scalable on aws while managing sensitive financial data was a significant challenge
how the technical challenges were solved
data inconsistency across pdfs

we implemented flexible parsing rules and custom extraction logic using pdf plumber by mapping key data points dynamically based on keywords and positions we could reliably extract relevant information
text recognition errors in ocr

we enhanced ocr performance by training the model specifically on sample financial documents improving recognition accuracy we also incorporated postprocessing validation checks to identify and correct common errors
realtime data processing

we optimized the backend by implementing asynchronous data processing using flask and pythons concurrency features this enabled realtime data calculations without blocking the primary data extraction process
dynamic frontend personalization

we modularized the frontend using react components allowing each dealership to customize their branding independently components like logos colors and layouts were made configurable through a simple dashboard
scalability and security

the aws instance was secured using vpc iam and other standard protocols we utilized documentdb for mongodb compatibility and implemented automated backups to ensure data integrity and scalable storage
business impact
increased efficiency

dealerships can now analyze financial performance more efficiently reducing manual work and errors by automating the data extraction and reporting process
enhanced customization

the dynamic dashboards provide a personalized user experience allowing dealerships to reflect their unique branding and business priorities
datadriven decisionmaking

realtime financial insights enable dealerships to make strategic decisions quickly improving profitability and operational efficiency
compliance and transparency

with accurate data extraction and visualization dealerships can ensure compliance with financial regulations while providing transparent reports for stakeholders
scalable solution

hosted on aws the system can easily handle an increasing number of dealerships adapting to the growing demand for dynamic dashboards
