the problem
create an api service that will parse text include comments analyse the remarks assign a score based on sentiment or other criteria etc feed it comments and it should analyse the syntax and sentiment of the comments as well as extract key terms to add to the extended meta data of that model in order for us to know a users behaviour personal information and more meta data about their interests
our solution
created a flask api that will take comments as input and will textual analysis as follows
spell and grammar check
 we have used
language tool python
for this 
languagetool
is an opensource grammar tool also known as the spellchecker for openoffice this library allows you to detect grammar errors and spelling mistakes through a python script or through a commandline interface
sentimental analysis
 for sentimental analysis we used flair flair is a pretrained embeddingbased model this means that each word is represented inside a vector space words with vector representations most similar to another word are often used in the same context this allows us to therefore determine the sentiment of any given vector and therefore any given sentence
keywords extraction

for keywords extraction we used
spacy
which is newer than nltk or scikitlearn is aimed at making deep learning for text data analysis as simple as possible the following are the procedures involved in extracting keywords from a text using spacy
split the input text content by tokens
extract the hot words from the token list
set the hot words as the words with pos tag 
propn
 
adj
 or 
noun
 pos tag list is customizable
find the most common t number of hot words from the list
