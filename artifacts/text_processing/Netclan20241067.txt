the problem
extract fundingrelated data from news articles from  websites such as company name funded amount participated investors and other details
create a web app to manage the extraction of funding  data
our solution
there were  websites from fundingrelated articles so we couldnt make a crawler for each website so we used an inbuilt web crawler provided by elasticsearch when we have extracted articles then we need to extract funding related information company name fund amount and investors participated etc then we decided to use nlps questionanswering method in which we need to train transformers to extract fundingrelated information first we have created some keywords based approaches to create labels for each field we need to extract to train models after that we have trained distil bert model on labelled data on aws ecs gpu server we applied this approach for all the fields we need to extract we got  accuracy for the company name field and for other fields we got  accuracy
to manage and view all the fields of extracted funding data we created a web app using python flask in this we created several pages to show extracted raw data by crawler  cleaned data after applying some cleaning functions and final output which have all the fields  we also created admin dashboard pages to show daily crawling status how many articles processed in one day total final output etc

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the client wanted to extract data from  different websites and if we make any crawler it only works for one website so it was not possible to create a  web crawler
how to extract funding information from an article it is very difficult to extract that type of information from normal python code by defining keywords because every website has different types of articles
how the technical challenges were solved
to solve web crawlerrelated issues we used elasticsearch web crawler which is very fast and can extract multiple websites at a time in this we need to create an engine and add websites that we want to scrape after that we added some keywords to extract only fundingrelated articles we set up this crawler to run every hour so we can get new articles every hour
to extract fundingrelated information we collected articles from different websites and created labels for each field we wanted to extract after that we have finetuned the transformers distilbert model on our labeled data  we used these models to extract fundingrelated information we also created an automated python script that uses these model on every extracted article and extracts fundingrelated information
business impact
this fundingrelated data would be used in two ways from this project companies can find suitable investors for their startups companies can search for investors based on industry verticals etc and find investors to help their startups
investors can use it to find a startup in which they want to invest based on their preferences like industry verticals etc
