project description
we need to use a pretrained bert question answering model and create a notebook that has explanations of models working with some visuals of bertviz allennlp and gradient values
our solution
we created a notebook first and explained the model with model view and head view visuals of bertviz library it gives similarity between words so we can easily find related words
we used the allennlp library and created bar charts and heatmaps to show higher and lower attention words it means when it finds question related words in the context it gives higher value to those words and if words are not related it gives lower values
we used a gradient based method to show higher and lower gradient values word according to question text and created bar charts and text color charts to show higher gradient values
project deliverables
a notebook which has an explanation of the bert question answering model using some visualization
tools used
google colab notebooks tensorflow bertviz allennlp transformers
languagetechniques used
python programming language deep learning nlp data visualization
models used
pretrained bertbaseuncased model and distilbert model both trained on squad dataset
skills used
data visualization deep learning nlp python
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
we need to use the best pretrained model which can give good results on different questions and answers
we were working on text data so we need to use charts which can clearly show differences between higher attention and lower attention value words
how the technical challenges were solved
for best pretrained we tried different berts pretrained models like distilberttrained on squad dataset distilberttrained on squad bert base uncased bert large and roberta base
among these models we kept the best one
for solving charts related issues we used heatmap chart bar chart with dark and light colors and text coloring method
