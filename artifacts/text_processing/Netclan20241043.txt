the problem
the client aimed to explore the development and deployment of custom tensorflow lite tflite models on voxl hardware the goal was to leverage the advanced gpu and npu acceleration capabilities of voxl to optimize and benchmark these models for efficient ondevice inference this project was not only about showcasing the potential of voxl in enhancing machine learning performance but also about contributing to the broader understanding of deploying custom models on edge devices
our solution
load base model in onnx format started with loading a base model like yolov or yolov in onnx format
convert onnx models to tflite format used the onnxtf parser for conversion
quantize models for voxl chips quantized models to float format for compatibility with voxl chips
clone voxl sdk developer environment cloned the voxl sdk developer environment and set up adb
connect voxl chip to your computer connected the voxl chip and verified the connection
access voxl chip shell accessed the shell of the voxl chip for model deployment and configuration
create deb packages with custom tflite models cloned the voxltfliteserver repository copied tflite files and configured the model
use custom deb package on voxl deployed the deb package and configured the voxl chip to run the model
run voxltfliteserver executed voxltfliteserver to start the inference process
verify model execution ensured the model runs without errors on the voxl chip
solution architecture
steps were followed as referred in the modal ai documentation no solution architecture was required here
deliverables
a python script implementing the cvrptw model
test data and scripts for simulating different scenarios
documentation explaining how to use the model and interpret the results

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
converting onnx models to tflite format for compatibility with the tflite runtime on voxl chips
quantizing models to float format for compatibility with the gpu and dpu delegations on voxl chips
setting up the voxl sdk developer environment and ensuring adb is correctly configured
deploying custom tflite models on the voxl chip and configuring it to run the models
benchmarking the model using the voxllogger tool and encountering issues with the latest sdk build
how the technical challenges were solved
used the onnxtf parser for model conversion ensuring compatibility
quantized models to float format improving inference speed and reducing model size
cloned the voxl sdk developer environment and followed the documentation to set up adb
cloned the voxltfliteserver repository copied tflite files and configured the model for deployment on the voxl chip
consulted with the voxl forums and developers for alternative methods of benchmarking due to sdk build issues
business impact the successful deployment and benchmarking of custom tflite models on voxl chips have significantly enhanced the clients ability to optimize machine learning performance on edge devices by leveraging the advanced gpu and npu acceleration capabilities of voxl the client has been able to achieve efficient ondevice inference showcasing the potential of voxl in the machine learning domain
business impact
this project has not only contributed to the broader understanding of deploying custom models on edge devices but has also provided valuable insights into the performance of these models on voxl chips the process of overcoming technical challenges has further solidified the clients confidence in the capabilities of voxl and the potential of deploying custom tflite models on edge devices
overall the manu b voxl project has been a success demonstrating the potential of voxl in enhancing machine learning performance on edge devices and contributing to the broader understanding of deploying custom models on edge devices the project has highlighted the importance of overcoming technical challenges and the value of comprehensive guides for deploying and benchmarking tflite models on voxl chips
