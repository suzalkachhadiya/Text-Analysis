project objective
conducting statistical data analysis on the data provided for different types of reinforced concrete using  different fibers  steel date palm and polypropylene fibers and also helping in preparing good research paper based on laboratory data
project description
the project had two phase
phase 
in this phase we had to do a comprehensiveÂ analysis on the data given and finally build statistical models for the variables present the main motive was to understand the behaviour of concrete based on various parameters  compressive strength flexural strength water absorption capabilities of the concrete and many more the analysis should include but was not limited to
comparison of mo control mix with all mixes at  days for each parameter test
comparing all parameters for all specimens all concrete mixes with  days and also  months heatcool and wetdry
all other expected analysis we could see you and do
phase 
in this phase we had to develop a structure for the research paper based on the results and analysis the paper included sections  abstract introduction  literature background and objective experimental program  materials and methods results and discussion  analysis and interpretation and conclusion  summary insights and remarks
our solution
providing a comprehensive analysis for the concrete data  showcasing the key insights from it based on the parameters compressive strength etc on the basis of results from the analysis research paper was drafted which included all the deliverable
project deliverable
a manuscript drafted article with the following
abstract
introduction  literature background and objective
experimental program  materials and methods
results and discussion  analysis and interpretation
conclusion  summary insights and remarks

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the challenges faced during project execution are
getting statistical models from seaborn libraries there is no direct way to get the models from the graphs created from data
building models in excel and validating it didnt know how had to learn it before applying it
how the technical challenges were solved
i had to use different libraries for building the models later on turned to ms excel and spreadsheet because they were building models and were also able to showcase it on the data itself for this i learned how to build models on the aforementioned software through youtube and blogs
