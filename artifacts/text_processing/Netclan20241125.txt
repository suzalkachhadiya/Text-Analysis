project objective
make data ready for predictive modelling
making google data studio dashboard
project description
phase   in this project first of all we have to clean the data as the data was very noisy we have to filter out only the needed columns of the data
phase   finding corelation between the pitchbook data and the other output files
phase   making dashboard in google data studio for the project
our solution
we used pandas and numpy to clean the data and make useful for it to be used in predictive modelling we have found the corelation between the tempa msa pitchbook data and the output files like textual file aimltm file etc we have made the dashboard using the google data studio
project deliverables
we have provided a excel file consisting of clean data and the google data studio report
tools used
python google data studio google chrome
languagetechniques used
python programming
models used
waterfall model used in this project
skills used
data cleaning data preprocessing data visualisation are used in this project
databases used
we have used the traditional file systems as database storage
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
cleaning the data was the major challenge faced while executing the project the data has a lot of noise it was difficult to find which data was useful and which data is not useful in this project secondly the co relation between the output files and pitchbook data there was nothing common between both the datasets so was difficult to find corelation between them
how the technical challenges were solved
we used pandas dataframe to clean the data and make it ready for predictive modelling and used the google data studio to find insights between the different datasets
