the problem
create an automated trading application with fully automated trading capabilities from selecting pair of assets to buyingselling assets this application uses ai to decide what action to take while trading
our solution
we have integrated coinapi with the application from which data is extracted we have created the homepage for this application we have changed the code structure of the front end to make it more fast and efficient
solution architecture
an application where the first automated top asset pair selection happens if the coins are cointegrated then only one indicator must be executed else trading starts based on  indicators
the ai agent will take specific action to trade based on the algorithm

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
we faced an issue while integrating coin api with the application while retrieving the data to retrieve the data using the coin api we need to input a symbol id this symbol id is a combination of exchangename symboltype currencywewanttotrade and quotecurrency there are n coins that can be retrieved using coin api there are more than multiple exchanges multiple symbol types and multiple quote currencies for one single coin this makes there is a huge no of combinations for one single coin this made the execution of the api integration very slow
how the technical challenges were solved
we created one dropdown for exchange selection one dropdown for symbol type selection one drop for coin and one dropdown for quote currency selection the user selects these and in the backend a combination is created and is sent as input to the coin api code and the data is retrieved without slowing down the process
