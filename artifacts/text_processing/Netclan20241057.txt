project objective
develop the recommendation engine
itembased collaborative filtering based on the use case of the project
work on streaming data platform ie bangdb
data generation for testing the platform
project description
bangdb is the platform that manages the static data stored on the cluster and also works with live streaming data as hadoop does wherever the bangdb is able to manage machine learning model deployment with their inbuilt parameter and hyper tuning parameters for each model
streaming data from the client which relates to the customer details and the numbers of products offered by the client on their platform such as insurance loans business loans and personal loans mobile recharge upi transactions done by their platform etc
they wanted the recommendation of other services provided by them to each of their customers who are using their platform
our solution
this project module develops according to the clients requirements which involves itembased collaborative filtering based on customer behaviour firstly classify the customers into various segments on the basis of age location gender and product usage on the basis of rfm marketing tactics to classify the customer on the basis of their purchase history amount spend and frequency of usage of product classify them and recommend them the other services based on itembased collaborative filtering
we generated the synthetic data  million events for the testing of the recommendation model and its accuracy for recommending the other products to customers

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
decide the recommendation engine based on the use case
finding the rfm score and classifying the customers into clusters
graph model to define the relations of customers with each service which they are using
synthetic data generation million events and around  gb structured data
how the technical challenges were solved
itembased collaborative filtering solves the issue of recommendation because we are dealing with almost   services
clustering of customers based on their similarities
measure the rfm score and group and classify them based on their scores
graph database provides to reduce complexity and increase the processing speed
data generation is one of the difficult tasks and generating relational data across  different streams using copula and uuid python library function which is based on pytorch
business impact
it is qualitative and quantitative impact on economically where customers are a direct impact of these projects in their life
it is suggesting to the customers what services they have to utilize from the provider and this is a direct impact of the product on the customers
product is providing the action statement of the usage of services by the customers and impacts them economically as well
the scope impact of product service is nationwide or statewide
to provide these impactfull services there is a tech team of blackcoffer behind it
