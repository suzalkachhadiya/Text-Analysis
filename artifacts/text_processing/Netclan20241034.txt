what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the problem was the higher gpu limit is required to process the big dataset
how the technical challenges were solved
we shifted our notebook from google colab to kaggle notebook as it offers more gpu usage limits also we took sample data from a given big dataset and processed it quickly
business impact
the project successfully implemented a text classification solution using bertbased models the model achieved promising results in classifying people into organizational categories the documentation outlines the steps from data loading to model training and evaluation providing a comprehensive project overview
