what we do
development of ea robot for automated trading
objective
the goal of this project is to build an expert advisor ea robot that automates trading by using predictions generated from a machine learning ml model the ea will operate in realtime leveraging both historical and live data to make buysell decisions data can be obtained via two primary methods
api
 a free version that provides limited data for a single currency pair and a paid version offering access to multiple pairs
trading platforms
 fx pro or xm which will serve as direct sources for realtime trading data
additionally the ea robot will use an mql script that defines the trading strategy enabling automated trading on any metatrader  mt platform the core focus is to train an ml model for predictive trading integrate data streams and implement a scalable mql strategy for execution
key steps
 project setup
api and platform access

obtain api credentials for both free and paid versions
set up fx pro or xm trading platforms and retrieve login details
ensure compatibility with metatrader  mt for seamless integration
test api connection

test api endpoints to verify data retrieval for currency pairs this ensures realtime data flow for both historical and live trading
 data retrieval and preparation
api data integration

set up api connections to retrieve historical and live trading data
the free version will provide access to data for a single currency pair eg eurusd while the paid version allows for multiple pairs eg gbpusd gold usdcad etc
fx pro  xm data handling

integrate fx pro and xm platforms for data reading and trade execution
use python and mt libraries to retrieve realtime data for selected currency pairs
historical data storage

collect historical data for model training storing it in a structured format eg csv for further processing
 model development and training
feature engineering

compute technical indicators eg rsi macd ema for selected currency pairs using historical data
generate buysell signals for training ensuring the data reflects actual market patterns
model training

develop and train the model using historical data to predict buysell signals by choosing appropriate ml model like  xgboost lstm or reinforcement learning
focus on ensuring that the model can generalize well to unseen data and respond effectively to market changes
model evaluation

evaluate model performance based on metrics like accuracy precision recall and profit optimization
adjust and finetune hyperparameters for improved predictive performance
 backtesting and performance evaluation
backtesting framework setup
develop a system to test the model on historical data
performance metrics definition
define relevant metrics eg sharpe ratio drawdown
strategy backtesting
run the model through historical data to evaluate performance
results analysis
analyze backtesting results and identify areas for improvement
 realtime data integration
realtime data handling

set up continuous data feeds via apis or fx proxm platforms fetching realtime trading data at regular intervals eg  minutes
ensure that the data is cleaned preprocessed and normalized on the fly for live prediction purposes
technical indicators calculation

compute technical indicators on realtime data ensuring the model uses uptodate market conditions
prediction script

develop scripts to apply the trained model to realtime data and generate buysell predictions
 mql script development
strategy implementation

develop an mql script that includes the trading strategy based on model predictions are creates an interface between the ai system and trading platform
the script will incorporate logic for stoploss takeprofit and position sizing ensuring that risk management is integrated
platform compatibility

ensure the mql script is compatible with any mt platform for easy deployment
execution of trades

implement a system where the ea uses the strategy to execute trades automatically based on the models predictions

this approach ensures the development of a robust datadriven ea robot that integrates ml predictions with realtime trading platforms and apis it also guarantees flexibility for live trading on various currency pairs and adaptability to changing market conditions
