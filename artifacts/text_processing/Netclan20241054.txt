what we do
ai chatbot using llm langchain llama
objective
the primary objective of the is to develop a highly efficient ai chatbot tailored for eye care patients the chatbot will assist in booking appointments tracking the status of lens orders reviewing patient dues sending statements and answering general questions about their exams and the practice it will integrate customtrained qlora models using opensource llms twilio for sms communication and retrievalaugmented generation rag for handling confidential data using vector databases like chromadb the ai related apis will be developed using fastapiflask and additional functionalities such as booking appointment handling dues management and order tracking will be managed by the backend system
solution architecture
solution overview 
the solution architecture is designed to integrate various components to provide a seamless user experience the architecture includes
custom qlora model training
 training opensource models like llama and mixtral with domainspecific data to ensure accurate and relevant responses
twilio sms integration
 utilizing twilios api to send and receive sms for appointment confirmations reminders and other notifications
rag for confidential data
 implementing retrievalaugmented generation rag using chromadb for secure and efficient access to confidential data
api development with fastapi
 building restful apis using fastapi to handle communication between the frontend and backend and to manage data transactions
backend functionality
 handling all other functionalities such as booking appointments dues management and order tracking through robust backend api services
qlora model training
qlora
qlora is the extended version of lora which works by quantizing the precision of the weight parameters in the pretrained llm to bit precision typically parameters of trained models are stored in a bit format but qlora compresses them to a bit format this reduces the memory footprint of the llm making it possible to finetune it on a single gpu this method significantly reduces the memory footprint making it possible to run llm models on less powerful hardware including consumer gpus
the qlora model training involves the following steps
data collection
 gather domainspecific data including faqs appointment details and patient interactions
preprocessing
 clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for model training
training
 utilize qlora training platforms to train the llama or mistral models on gpu resources
finetuning
 finetune the model using qlora models
evaluation
 evaluate the model performance and make necessary adjustments

llm selection

llm selection mistral b  llama  b  llama  b
selection criteria
the selection of the llm large language model will be based on the performance evaluation of three opensource models mistral b llama  b and llama  b the primary criteria for selection include
performance
 the accuracy and relevance of responses during testing phases
resource efficiency
 ability to run efficiently on cpus and low vram gpus
scalability
 ease of scaling the model for increased usage without significant degradation in performance
compatibility
 integration with existing infrastructure and ease of use in the deployment environment
testing and evaluation
each model will be subjected to a series of tests designed to measure their performance in realworld scenarios these tests will include
accuracy tests
 evaluating the correctness and relevance of the responses provided by the models using a diverse set of queries
resource utilization tests
 monitoring cpu and gpu usage to ensure models run efficiently on limited resources
latency tests
 measuring response times to ensure the chatbot can handle realtime interactions smoothly
scalability tests
 testing the models under increased load to ensure they can handle a growing number of users without performance issues
models under consideration and reasoning behind their selection
mistral b
overview
 mistral b is known for its efficiency and ability to provide accurate responses with lower computational requirements
strengths
 high accuracy and relevance in responses efficient use of computational resources and good scalability
use cases
 ideal for scenarios requiring fast and accurate responses with minimal resource usage
llama  b
overview
 llama  b builds on the strengths of its predecessor with improvements in performance and efficiency
strengths
 enhanced accuracy better resource utilization and improved response times
use cases
 suitable for deployments where slightly better performance is required without significantly increasing resource consumption
llama  b
overview
 the latest in the llama series llama  b offers the highest performance among the three models under consideration
strengths
 superior accuracy and relevance efficient performance on low vram gpus and excellent scalability
use cases
 best for applications needing the highest accuracy and capable of handling more complex queries while still being resourceefficient
final selection
the final selection will be made based on the comprehensive evaluation of the models during the testing phase the model that demonstrates the best overall performance in terms of accuracy efficiency and scalability will be chosen for deployment this approach ensures that the chosen model will not only meet the current requirements but will also be capable of scaling with future needs providing a robust and reliable solution for the ai chatbot
by focusing on models that are optimized for both cpus and low vram gpus we ensure costeffective deployment and operation making the solution accessible and sustainable for a wide range of applications
