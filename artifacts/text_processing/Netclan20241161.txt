project objective
the main objective of this project is to find the pattern in the vital signs of patients who were admitted to the hospital in past and from this pattern we get some ranges that help us to give early warnings
project description
we are more interested in nonsurvivor patients vital signs as compare to survivor patients we find patterns in
vital signs
that could better determine that patient died ex if sp is below  patient in  of cases died if sp is below  the death rate is  or we can take correlations which can help us to find better patterns to define death cases
data the dataset which was used for analysis here is taken from the mimic website but the dataset is not in the correct format which we want after some manipulation we get the data ready for the analysis
our solution
approach
to protect patient confidentiality date and time is shifted to future thats not the actual time so from shifted time column we create an extra column hour which tells us the time passed in hours since first observation in icu
after all manipulation our final dataset contain vital signs values for each observation of patients with time in separate column and also the label fo death  or  in another column
there are two options to deal with missing values
drop all rows which contain null values
fill the missing values by some method using pandas
i cant go with st option because a major part of the data has missing values so i decided to go with the second option and fill missing values with the average of upper and lower values but before that i filtered the data and take only those patients data who died in a hospital or survive
project deliverables
after performing eda which also include the removal of some impossible outliers we come up with a result of analysis
this result helps to build an early warning system which predict the condition of patients on the basis of their score calculated on their condition using vital sign values
