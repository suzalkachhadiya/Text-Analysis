what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
merging reports from different data sources
 faced the issue of making the cross report from different data sources
take live parameter input daily in dashboards from user
 taking live user parameter input daily to feed in wink report dashboard so that dashboard kpis can change accordingly
how the technical challenges were solved
merging reports from different data sources
 resolved this issue by using merge report configuration using this we were able to join tables from different data sources like  left join  right join  union etc
take live parameter input daily in dashboards from user
 to resolve this issue  we added a custom field in reports with input tag users can enter their parameter in this custom field and all dashlets in the dashboard would update automatically
