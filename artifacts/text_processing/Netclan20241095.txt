project objective
fetch currency data from pureclear api and store it to google cloud bigquery
create a google cloud function to automate the above process
project description
we have given a pureclear api and a google cloud account we need to fetch currency data from that pureclear api using python and need to store fetched data in google cloud bigquery
we also need to automate the above process like the process runs on a daily basis and update the currency data on bigquery
our solution
we have created a python program that can fetch pureclear api data the api data was in json format but we needed table format so we used python package pandas we converted json data to tabular format using pandas after that we connected python code to google cloud using googles authentication module and then stored data frame table directly to bigquery using the togbq method
we also need to run the above process daily to update new data in bigquery for this google cloud provides a cloud function tool in this we can create a function and set up their running process so we created a function and attached the above code to that function and set up a cloud function to run daily
project deliverables
a google cloud function that runs daily and updates data on google bigquery
tools used
cloud function bigquery of google cloud google colab notebook python programming pandas
languagetechniques used
python language and pandas module
skills used
python programming data handling google cloud
databases used
google cloud bigquery
web cloud servers used
google cloud server
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
connecting google cloud to python code is challenging because its credentials should be in a specified format otherwise it shows an authentication error
how the technical challenges were solved
to tackle this challenge we created a dictionary format keyvalue pair and stored all the authentication variables in the dictionary as a key value pair then we used googles authentication library googleauth and passed a dictionary to the serviceaccount method and stored it in different variables so we can store data from pandas dataframe to google bigquery
