project description
the objective was to develop a progress bar that can help costumes to estimate the analytics of the video
our solution
the client wanted a progress bar with the following filters
date filter  update the progress bar and count of the videos according to the date selected
category filter  update the progress bar and the count of the videos according to the selected category
we have created a sql query for getting a count of the videos from the full video table according to the filter selected in the app
in added video table some columns were missing to solve this we created a sql query for joining the added video table to the other tables and return the count of the video according to the filter selected
