project objective
for the current project we hope to develop a realtime dashboard  it updates every several minutes currently we have multiple ubuntu machines that are sending messages every minute to apache pulsar
project description
developing a realtime updating dashboard to display the metadata of various machines on a server from pandio queue
the dahboard must display the count of inactive  active and down servers with a table displaying the details of all the machines in different color scheme for each type of servermachine
our solution
we used django framework to develop the dashboard as it didnt require the ec instance to be active on machine which was the problem with using streamlit
for communication between webpage and fetched data we used django channel 
we used django background task module to make the fetching run forever in background
