project objective
project population and community survey of america objective were to perform data abstraction data structurization data preprocessing data cleaning and combining data from all the years listed and finally presenting insights of the data by exploratory data analysis
project description
for project population and community survey of america task involved fetching json and unformatted csv data from numerous web links further needed to process data handling nested json data conversion of json data in dataframe performing certain pandas operation for feature selection and structuring data concat all this data into one csv file then handle missing value by mapping with another dataset finally perform certain data visualization and exploratory data analysis
our solution
module  data abstraction
the process of data abstraction involves collecting data from numerous web links from year  to  and viewing the data using json viewer in tree format
module  data chunking and integration
was unable to process data in pandas so performed data chunking with chunksize  rows at a time for year  likewise performed for all other years data till  and finally combined all the dataframes into one containing all data from year  to 
module  handling complexity of nested data  format the unformatted csv files
handling unformatted csv in proper comma separated format so that data frame can be formed dataframe produced after merging for all the years from  to  contains a lot of nested json data among certain attributes so performed normalization of nested json forming newcolumns naming them based on their attributes key
 module  data cleaning and preprocessing
involves handling missing value contraction mapping with another dataset to fill the missing statezipcode column handling inf and inf within the dataset for some attributes and forming a new column populationratio based on passing formula among other attributes
 module  data analysis
this step involves forming a correlation matrix to understand the relation between numeric attributes performed exploratory data analysis on strong correlated attributes to understand patternrelation between them
project deliverables
after completion of project we provided
final preprocessed csv files
three ipython files
preprocessed dataset from year  to

models used
my project population and community survey of america developed with a software model which makes the project high quality reliable and cost effective
 software model  radrapid application development model model
 this project follows a rad model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start also my project was based on prototyping without any specific planning in the rad model there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks it targets developing software in a short span of time
 advantages of rad model
o changing requirements can be accommodated
o progress can be measured
o iteration time can be short with use of powerful rad tools
o productivity with fewer people in a short time
o reduced development time
o increases reusability of components
o quick initial reviews occur
o encourages customer feedback
o integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issues
skills used
pandas operations
data chunking and integration
data visualization
exploratory data analysis
databases used
no database is used in this project only used google drive for storing and transferring data
web cloud servers used
no web server is used
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
data cleaning and filling out missing values by data mapping with another dataset as the data was not in proper format in the another dataset
how the technical challenges were solved
data cleaning was done using a few built in pandas operations to deal with missing values ordering data columns data formatting changing of data types and many more filling of remaining missing data from columns using outer join among the datasets and using map function of python

figure  output data schema from year  to 
figure  dataset for year 
figure  is pandas dataset of year  which has  rows and  columns which was fetched from authenticated survey web portal data obtained were in json format which were converted into pandas dataframe likewise there are dataframes created from year  to 
figure Â  output preprocessed dataset
figure  is an output preprocessed dataset from  to  which has  rows and  columns

figure  bar plot of attribute statename
figure  represents the bar plot among the statename on the final output dataset from year  till 
figure  kde graph for all numeric population data column of dataset
figure  represents the kernel density estimate plotkde among all population estimate data columns for the preprocessed dataset kde plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset analogous to a histogram kde represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions plotted many more graphs apart this between highly correlated attributes like pair plot box plot line plot etc
