project objective
to make a software code that takes data from a source and ingests it into a database present on a server the scripts should automatically execute after regular intervals of time
project description
the client had several data sources that were updated with new data regularly the client wanted software that triggers itself automatically and takes data from those data sources and ingests it into a database that is hosted on a linode server also the date parameters in the query should be changed dynamically using the current date further we had to assist in setting up the tableau bi tool on the clients pc and connect the postgres database to the tableau
our solution
we setup a linux server on linode
install postgres on this linux server
create a database and create a new user grant this new user all privileges on the database
create a table within the database this table has columns with datatypes as specified by the client
write a python script that makes get request to the client specified data source and store the response in json format
inside the python script itself establishÂ  a connection to our postgres database using the pscopg module and user credentials
ingest the data into postgres using insert query in python script
write code to get the todays date using the datetime module using this calculate yesterdays date now we can use these as parameters inside our query to the data source
move these python files to our server
install and setup cron on our server
add the task to run specified python files at regular intervals to cron
repeat steps  to  for every new data source

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
avoiding duplicates was a challenge
since client was living in australia all the timezone on server and in code were changed to aedt
how the technical challenges were solved
used uniqueid column to check for duplicates
used pytz module to change timezones
business impact
this solution helps in maintaining a copy of all data sources inside our postgres database also the data is  available since data inside the postgres is updated regularly graphs in the tableau are also up to date
