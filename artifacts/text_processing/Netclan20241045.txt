the problem
the sports coaching organization esra salih faced the challenge of efficiently allocating coaches to various programs across different schools the allocation process was previously manual and inefficient leading to inadequate coachprogram matching and inefficient use of coaches time the organization needed a system that could automatically assign coaches to programs based on specific criteria such as coach availability program preferences and the number of students enrolled in each program
our solution
we developed a custom system that divides the academic year into different terms and assigns coaches to programs based on a set of criteria the system filters coaches based on their preferences and allocates them to programs efficiently it ensures that coaches do not have to travel excessively and that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold once a coach is assigned to a program they are allocated for subsequent program days ensuring consistency
the development process will involve several stages
understanding the data well analyze the data to identify the relevant variables and constraints these may include the locations of installations the duration of installations the availability of team members and customer preferences
defining the objective and constraints the objective will be to minimize the total travel time or maximize the number of installations completed within a given time frame the constraints will include the geographical distances between locations the working hours of team members and the specific requirements of each installation
implementing the algorithm well use an optimization algorithm such as the traveling salesman problem tsp solver to find the optimal routes the algorithm will consider all possible routes and choose the one that best meets the objectives while adhering to the constraints
running simulations to ensure the feasibility of the model well run simulations using different scenarios and adjust the parameters as needed
saving the output the final output will be the suggested schedules which can then be reviewed and approved by the relevant parties
in terms of technology well use python a popular language for data analysis and machine learning well also use the anaconda distribution which provides a powerful environment for scientific computing and data analysis
solution architecture
the system is built on a custom logic implementation that filters programs for a particular date and checks the past history of the program to see if a coach was assigned before if not it allocates a new coach based on their availability and feasibility to reach the program location in time a filtered list of coaches based on preferences like agegroup and level is created to aid this process

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the main challenge was developing a custom logic implementation that could efficiently allocate coaches to programs based on specific criteria
another challenge was ensuring that the system could handle scenarios where multiple coaches were required for a program
how the technical challenges were solved
the first challenge was addressed by developing a custom logic implementation that filters programs for a particular date and checks the past history of the program to see if a coach was assigned before if not it allocates a new coach based on their availability and feasibility to reach the program location in time
the second challenge was addressed by initially focusing on assigning a single coach and gradually introducing the complexity of multiple coaches after the basic system was functional
business impact
the implementation of the proposed solution has significantly improved the efficiency of the coach allocation process the system has automated the allocation process saving valuable time and resources that were previously spent on manual updates it has also ensured that coaches are allocated in a way that minimizes travel and ensures that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold
