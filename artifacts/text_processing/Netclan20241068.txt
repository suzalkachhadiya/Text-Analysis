project objective
fetch all call logs using zendesk api from drivelah server
analyse call logs and  number of calls made by a particular phone number to company and fetch recent call timing
project description
we need to fetch last months call details from user to user calltime callstatus  using zendesk api
then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server
our solution
to fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming when we checked call details in the zendesk api the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details so first we have fetched only needed details call made from person to person and call timing converted into tabular format in tabular format it was easy to identify call details
after that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month  we used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data first we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique users call records for recent dates we used pythons datetime module which can easily identify recent date time
project deliverables
 python scripts
for fetching call details and converting into table format
for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing
tools used
vs code google drive and ms excel

python programming language data analytics with numpy and pandas python datetime
skills used
data analytics python mathematics
databases used
local data from ms excel sheet
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
first one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data
the date format in the api data is not appropriate for us  to handle because the date is  stored in string format it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones
how the technical challenges were solved
for the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from apis json format and converted these details in tabular format in python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details
for the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format so we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using pythons datetime module it has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another  so from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls
