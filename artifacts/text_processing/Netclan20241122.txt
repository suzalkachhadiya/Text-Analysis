project objective
create a voice and chatbot using aws lex which can book flights hotels cars and book some fun activities in a city
project description
we need to create a voice and chatbot using aws lex and lambda function the bot should book a flight a hotel and a car by asking some relevant questions to the user like destination origin date etc we also need to create a combination of all these which can plan the whole trip flight hotel car and book some fun activities
our solution
we have created aws lex intents and lambda functions for all bookings intents manage front ends like utterances user can ask to the bot and slots bot replies with relevant questions lambda functions manage backend parts like which intent should be triggered if the user says  book a flight or book a hotel or book a car for search results we have used some external apis like amadeus for flight sabre for hotels and blablacar for car booking  we have modified search results by using data analytics for getting the cheapest and good star flight and hotel machine learning for getting users preferences by analyzing users history and nlp differentiate search results by text analysis techniques so users can get the best search results
project deliverables
an aws lex voice and chatbot which can book flight hotel car and fun activities this can be integrated with ios applications

what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the first challenge we have faced is the integration of aws lex and lambda functions
amadeus and sabre apis data was not in a good format so we have to clean some data and organize it in a usable format
we need to make some apis so we can pass flight or hotel parameters and the apis will give flight or hotel related data
create a book button in the bot for booking flights hotels and car
how the technical challenges were solved
so the integration of aws lex and lambda function was very tough for us because lex uses some intentes to show responses from the lambda function so we have created different lex intents to pass messages to lex bot from lambda function and put some good coding to the lambda function so different messages can be handled by different intents
for flight hotel and car search results we were using some external apis like amadeus sabre and blablacars apis these apis have a lot of data and are not in a format we need  so first we cleaned data and then sorted data according to cheaper and best ratings results we have used the best two results among all the results
we cannot use all the machine learning and data analytics part in aws lambda function so what we did was we created some rest apis which can handle all the data analytics and machine learning part and we hosted these apis on aws ec instance we used these apis in our lambda functions
so creating a button in a chat bot or voice bot is always so different from providing text messages for creating a button we used a response card structure in lambda function which can handle button and button related responses
