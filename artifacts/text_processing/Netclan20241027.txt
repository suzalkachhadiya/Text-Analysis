the problem
to improve the accuracy to  where the current models which were built were giving an accuracy of  the existing predictive models are currently achieving an accuracy of  which is insufficient for meeting the desired performance benchmarks the objective is to enhance the accuracy of these models to exceed  this requires a comprehensive evaluation and improvement of the model development process including data quality feature engineering algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning the challenge lies in identifying and implementing effective strategies to significantly boost the models predictive accuracy while ensuring robustness and generalizability
our solution
our solution architecture is designed to efficiently preprocess financial data perform feature selection and train a gru gated recurrent unit model for predictive analysis the architecture comprises the following components
data preprocessing involves loading the dataset from a csv file checking for null values and performing initial exploratory data analysis eda
feature selection utilizes correlation analysis to identify relevant features and drop irrelevant ones
model building constructs a gru model using tensorflows keras api consisting of multiple gru layers followed by dropout regularization and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function
model evaluation evaluates the trained model on test data to measure its performance
