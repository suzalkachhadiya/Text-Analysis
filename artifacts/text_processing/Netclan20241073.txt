the problem
to use data ingested into neoj and use the nodes and relationships with its properties to determine which nodes are actually the same person for eg we have person nodes in the data now people might enter their names in different ways our main aim is to identify person nodes that may have similar data and are actually the same person this will be represented as a perfect match between the nodes this singleperson view is referred to as the golden record
our solution
till date we have loaded data into neoj and created relationships with score property which defines match strength we have created some criterias by which we can determine what constitutes two nodes being the same and then based on them created perfect match and probable match
we have considered four properties for our criteria  full name address drivers license and passport number we have relationships between nodes for these properties with scores we use these in our perfect match and probable match creation
we have also configured graphlytics a viz software in the virtual machine which connects to the neoj database and helps vizualize the nodes and relationships
we have also worked on some algorithms using the gds library in neoj to produce more information on the graph the common neighbors algorithm was used to produce scores based on node similarity and the higher the score the higher the similarity other algorithms were tried as well but since all the properties are of string format it did not work on it
we have resolved issues neoj is facing when deleting a large set of data and provided steps to recover neoj if it fails by going outofmemory
we have figured out the issues with the probable and perfect match cypher queries not working as intended and proposed a solution
solution architecture
deliverables
created perfect match and probable match queries
created queries that return the nodes even if it does not have associated relationship and its associated relationship
a cypher query that return the result as a json object that can be mapped into a java oject
a cypher query that will create the relationship if two nodes properties  have same value
a cypher query that will delete one relationship from bidirectional relationship
a python code for a sample neoj query
adjust the perfect and probable match queries so it would work for  current data
