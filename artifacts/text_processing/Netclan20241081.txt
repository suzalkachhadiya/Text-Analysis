project objective
the objective of this project was to detect cars in satellite images and highlight them using a bounding box
project description
the client steffen schneider approached us with a requirement to develop a python project that dealt in the field of computer vision the main aim of the project was to detect cars present in a satellite image and highlight them using a bounding box to achieve this we decided to use the darknet model and train it on yolov dataset of cars in satellite images
our solution
we used google colab for coding and training the darknet model kaggle was used to download the yolov dataset of cars in satellite images we preprocessed the dataset and trained the model on it once the model was trained we tested it on sample satellite images and it worked perfectly fine finally we created a script that detected the cars in an image and highlighted them using a bounding box
project deliverables
the final deliverable was a ipython notebook presented on google colab
tools used
google colab kaggle slackfor communication
languagetechniques used
python
models used
darknetcv model
skills used
python programming aiml
what are the technical challenges faced during project execution
the main challenge we faced was related to the preprocessing of the yolov dataset of cars in satellite images the dataset was large and had to be cleaned and formatted before it could be used for training the model
how the technical challenges were solved
we used python programming skills and developed a script that automated the preprocessing of the dataset this saved us a lot of time and allowed us to focus on training the model
business impact
the project was a success and the client was very happy with the final product the car detection model worked perfectly fine on sample satellite images and could be used for further development of an application that could detect cars in realtime
